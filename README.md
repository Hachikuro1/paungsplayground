recently i found out having fun with python is actually enjoyable,
so i decided to learn pygame (i KNOW unity is way better but i have learnt it once and i uninstalled it, storage efficiency purposes.)
and right now i have progamming classes which uses python, and in lab sessions i find python playgrounds are actually enjoyable.

found this thing called **pygame** and my hope is i can convert my console playground into an ACTUAL game.
and hopefully this will help me carve my way into being the dreamt billionare renowned indie game dev (fucking impossible)

this repository will keep my fun codes on track, but you can explore my codes too, might aswell help or collaborate haha, feel free to do so
